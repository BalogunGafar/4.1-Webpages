<h1>My Best Top 5 Movies</h1>
<h2>I don't really watch Movies though</h2>

<hr />
<p>I want to really list out some things over here.</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Cat Family.<br />
        <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQPwSKt9dOMnSfMOGT85xE8sQAKyhk-L05MrZt6aigcDw&s">A drawing of a Cat</a>
        <ol><br />
           <li><strong>Tasmanian Devil;</strong></li>
           <p></p><a href="./indextas.html"><img src="./assets/images/tasmanian devil.jpg" alt="A voracious animal" /></a><p></p>
           <li><strong>Lions</strong></li>
           <p><a href="./indextas.html"><img src="./assets/images/lion.jpg" alt="A beautiful lion" /></a></p>   
        </ol> 
       </li> 
       <li>kaola;

        <ul>
           <li>They are small in size.</li>
           <li>They likely sleep all day long.</li>
           <li>They are friend animals;
               <ul>
                  <li>They are friendly because they look calm and they have soft hairs.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>They mostly spend their lives on trees.</li>
        </ul>  
       </li>

    </ul>
<h3>I would love to discuss about some other animals here:</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Pufferfish;</li><br />
      <a href="./indextas.html"><img src="./assets/images/Puffer fish.webp" alt="A growing puffer fish" /></a><br />   
      It is a very beautiful image and the organism itself also has stingers on its body,<br /> 
      which makes it unedible by the rest of the fishes in the water body. It is also not<br /> very big in size although it might look fat.
      <p><li>Mayfly;</p>
         <a href="./indextas.html"><img src="./assets/images/mayfly.webp" alt="A picture of clear mayfly" /></a>
          <ul><br />
            <li>It belongs to the order 'Ephemeroptera'.</li>
            <li>It can live for about 6months to 1year in the larvae stage</li>
            <li>Once it beomes an adult, it does not live up to 24hours before it dies.
               <ul>
                  <li>its primary aim is to reproduce onces it emerges as an adult.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>it is a tailed-insect i.e It has quite a long tail.</li>
          </ul>
         </li>
      <p><li>Tripod Fish;</li></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I don't really have much to say this particular fish cause it looks unimaginary at<br />
                first sight and it looks like it has three-legs.</li>
            <li>It also looks shiny, it may have some interesting properties which makes it unique<br />
                and special;
                 <ol>
                   <li>Maybe presence of oil in the body.
                     <ul>
                       <li><strong>Uropygial Gland;</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Squalene and Wax esters e.t.c.</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                   </li>
                 </ol>     
            </li>     
            <li>The fish looks like it would be so sweet to consume.</li>
